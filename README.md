# Selection Buttons

This is a play around with the radio and checkbox inputs designed by [GOV.UK](http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com).

More examples of the inputs can be seen [here](http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/form-elements/example-radios-checkboxes/).

## What is so interesting?

After doing some research the team at GOV.UK discovered users tend to click on the control rather than the label. Because of this they decided to make the contol larger to make the click target bigger for users. You can read more about the reasons in this [GDS Design notes](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2016/11/30/weve-updated-the-radios-and-checkboxes-on-gov-uk) post.

I really like their implementation so created this repo to play around with it.
